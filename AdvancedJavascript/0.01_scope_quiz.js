//What type of scoping rules does JavaScript have? Exceptions?
//A: Lexical scoping - Author-time determination of scope-blocks
//Exceptions: eval and the with keyword

//What are the different ways you can create a new scope?
//A:functions, catch blocks, curly braces with the let keyword

//What's the difference between undeclared and undefined?
//A:undefined is a value, undeclared means it hasn't been declared yet.
//undefined is a default value for a variable which hasn't yet been assigned a value.
//getting undefined means that there definitely was a declared variable.
//if a variable wasn't declared, then you'll get a reference error, instead.
